# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions

# Task: Add traps for the INT and QUIT signals. If the script receives an INT signal,
#       reset the count to the maximum and tell the user they are not allowed to interrupt
#       the count. If the script receives a QUIT signal, tell the user they found the secret
#       to getting out of the script and exit immediately.
trap reset 2
trap foundsecret 3
# Task: Explain in a comment how the line with the word moose in it works.

  echo "you have solution that how to exit from the script."

#### Variables
programName="$(basename $0)" # used by error_functions.sh
sleepTime=1 # delay used by sleeptime
numberOfSleeps=10 # how many sleeps to wait for before quitting for inactivity

#### Functions

# This function will send an error message to stderr
# Usage:
#   error-message ["some text to print to stderr"]
#
function error-message {
  #task :  It prints programname and first args
  # > redirect standard output (implicit 1)
  # $ what comes next is a file description , not a file (only for a right hand side of > )
  # 2 stderr file descriptor number
  # redirect stdout from echo command to stderr
        echo "${programName}: ${1:-Unknown Error - a moose bit my sister once...}" >&2
}

# This function will send a message to stderr and exit with a failure status
# Usage:
#   error-exit ["some text to print" [exit-status]]
#
