# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions

# Task: Add traps for the INT and QUIT signals. If the script receives an INT signal,
#       reset the count to the maximum and tell the user they are not allowed to interrupt
#       the count. If the script receives a QUIT signal, tell the user they found the secret
#       to getting out of the script and exit immediately.

trap int_reset 2
trap found_secret 3

function found_secret {
  echo "You found out the secret to getting out of the script."
  exit
}

# Task: Explain in a comment how the line with the word moose in it works.

#### Variables
programName="$(basename $0)" # used by error_functions.sh
sleepTime=1 # delay used by sleeptime
numberOfSleeps=10 # how many sleeps to wait for before quitting for inactivity

#### Functions

# This function will send an error message to stderr
# Usage:
#   error-message ["some text to print to stderr"]
#
#
#THis function is named error-message
#It will send an error message to stderr
#It uses the echo command to print the variable programName and the first arguments.
#It then redirects stdout (1)
#& is the file descriptor
#2 is used to denote stderr
#>&2 redirects stdout from echo command to stderr.

# This function will send a message to stderr and exit with a failure status
# Usage:
#   error-exit ["some text to print" [exit-status]]
#
