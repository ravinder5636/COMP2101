# this script generates a report of the files on the system that have the setuid permission bit turned on
# it is for the lab1 exercise

# Task 1 for the exercise is to modify it to also find and display the setgid files in a second listing
# The second listing should display after the setuid file list, and be formatted similar to the setuid file list

# Task 2 for the exercise is to modify it to also display the 10 largest files in the system, sorted by their sizes
# The listing should include the file name, owner, and size in MBytes and be displayed after the listings of setuid and setgid files
