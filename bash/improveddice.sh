# this script rolls a pair of six-sided dice and displays both the rolls and the sum
#

# Improve this script by re-organizing it to:
#  put the number of sides in a variable which is used as the range for the random number
#  put the bias, or offset, for the RANDOM number in a variable (it is 1 for our purposes)
#     - you can think of this as the minimum value for the generated number
#  roll the dice using the variables for the range and bias i.e. RANDOM % range + bias
#  generate the sum of the dice
#  generate the average of the dice
#  display a summary of what was rolled, and what the result was

# Tell the user we have started processing
echo "Rolling..."
sides=6
bias=1
RANDOM=$RANDOM
# roll the dice and save the results
die1=$(( RANDOM % 6 + 1))
die2=$(( RANDOM % 6 + 1 ))
# sum up the rolls
sum=$(( die1 + die2 ))
average=sum/2
# display the results
echo "Rolled $die1, $die2 for a $sum"
echo "Rolled $die1, $die2 and an average is $average"
